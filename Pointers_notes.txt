adress "&" will give adress of variable
*(&i); will give value of variable
j = &i; we need to declare it as int *j;
"*" :what it indicates 
It indicates value at adress
the value at adress contained in j is int type


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i=5;
    int *j;
    j=& i;
    printf("Adress of i is %u\n",&i);
    printf("adress of i is %u",j);
    return 0;
}

o/p:

Adress of i is 2016568268
adress of i is 2016568268




#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i=3;
    int *j;
    j=&i;
    printf("adress of i is %u\n",&i);
    printf("adress of i is %u\n",j);
    printf("adress of j is %u\n",&j);
    printf("value of i is %u\n",i);
    printf("value of i is %u\n",*j);
    printf("adress of i is %u\n",*(&i));
    return 0;
}

output:
adress of i is 1018348348
adress of i is 1018348348
adress of j is 1018348352
value of i is 3
value of i is 3
adress of i is 3


* alpha - It is a POINTER VARIABLE
variables capable of holding adresses.

adresses are always whole numbers.
pointers always contain whole numbers.


float*s;
it doesn't mean s is going to have floating value.
it actually means s is going to have adress of floating point value.
char *ch means ch going to have the adress of char value.
